You are working in a Flask + Jinja website.

TASK:
Implement a scroll-driven hero animation using an existing hero section.
The animation must behave like a smooth video scrub controlled by scroll.

REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT SIMPLIFY):

1. FRAME SEQUENCE (CORE)
- There are 192 PNG frames located in:
  static/underkilometer-frames/
- File naming format:
  exgif-frame-001.png
  exgif-frame-002.png
  ...
  exgif-frame-192.png

- As the user scrolls DOWN:
  → Frames must change sequentially
  → Animation must be smooth (60fps feel)
  → No flickering, no reloading on scroll
- Use requestAnimationFrame or scroll-based interpolation
- Frames must be PRELOADED before animation begins

2. HERO SECTION INTEGRATION
- The existing hero background element class is:
  .desktop-thq-hero-elm
- Replace the hero background behavior using a <canvas>
- The hero section must:
  - Stay fixed (or sticky) while frames are animating
  - Take up 100vh
  - Prevent normal page scrolling until frames finish

3. TEXT ANIMATION SYNCHRONIZED WITH SCROLL
- Inside the hero, add three text elements:
  a) Main title (large heading)
  b) About-section short paragraph
  c) One single-line punch sentence

- These texts must:
  - Fade in and fade out smoothly (opacity + transform)
  - Change based on scroll / frame ranges
  - Be perfectly synchronized with the frame animation

EXAMPLE TIMING (use proportional logic, not hard pixel values):
- Frames 0–60:
    Show title text
- Frames 61–120:
    Fade title out
    Fade in about text
- Frames 121–170:
    Fade in final sentence
- Frames 171–192:
    Fade everything out

4. SCROLL RELEASE AFTER ANIMATION
- Once frame 192 is reached:
  - Hero section must scroll away naturally
  - Normal page scroll behavior must resume
  - Following sections of the site must become visible

5. SMOOTHNESS & PERFORMANCE
- Use canvas for rendering frames (do NOT use img tags)
- Resize canvas properly on window resize
- Avoid layout shifts
- Mobile friendly but desktop-first
- No external libraries unless absolutely necessary

6. OUTPUT EXPECTED
You must:
- Modify HTML only where necessary
- Add clean CSS (responsive, minimal)
- Add ONE JavaScript file to handle:
  - Frame preloading
  - Scroll → frame mapping
  - Text fade animation
- Code must be readable and commented
- Respect existing class names and styling wherever possible

7. CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT break Flask routing or Jinja templates
- Do NOT hardcode absolute URLs
- Assume site is served from Flask static folder
- Maintain current visual styling outside hero section

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated hero HTML markup
- Required CSS additions
- A complete JS implementation for scroll-based animation
- Explanation of how the scroll lock and release is handled
